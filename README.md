## Problem Statement

Email spam, or junk mail, remains a persistent issue, flooding inboxes with unsolicited and often malicious content. These emails may contain cryptic messages, scams, or, most dangerously, phishing attempts. Our task, undertaken during an engaging data science internship provided by Oasis Infobyte, is to create an effective email spam detection system using Python and machine learning.
